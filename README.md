# Regression-Machine-Learning-Project
This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that deals with regression algorithms utilizing [Weka 3.8.6](https://waikato.github.io/weka-site/index.html). The first portion of the project features the housing.arff dataset and the final portion features the salary.arff dataset. The housing.arff dataset contains data about house prices in Boston and each instance describes the properties of a Boston suburb. The salary.arff dataset provides a comprehensive collection of salary information from various industries and regions across the globe and is sourced from reputable employment websites and surveys. It includes details on job titles, salaries, job sectors, geographic locations, and more.

## Project Goals

1.	Load the dataset.
2.	Analyze the dataset.
3.	Prepare views of the dataset.
4.	Evaluate algorithms.
5.	Tune algorithm performance.
6.	Evaluate ensemble algorithms.
7.	Present results.
